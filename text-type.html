<p class="big">Rapunzel" (/rəˈpʌnzəl/; German: [ʁaˈpʊnt͡səl]) is a German fairy tale in the collection assembled by the Brothers Grimm, and first published in 1812 as part of Children's and Household Tales.[citation needed] The Grimm Brothers' story is an adaptation of the fairy tale Rapunzel by (J. Achim Christoph) Friedrich Schulz published in his collection Kleine Romane (German: Little Romances (1790).[1] The Schulz version is based on Persinette by Charlotte-Rose de Caumont de La Force originally published in 1698[2] which in turn was influenced by an even earlier Italian tale, Petrosinella by Giambattista Basile, published in 1634.[3] Its plot has been used and parodied in various media and its best known line ("Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair") is an idiom of popular culture. In volume I of the 1812 annotations (Anhang), it is listed as coming from Friedrich Schulz's Kleine Romane, Book 5, pp. 269–288, published in Leipzig 1790. </p>
